any news here? Any estimate for releasing the findings?


[06/06/2022 4:39 PM] liveactionllamac4
Hi there! I think this one could finish up judging this week, then will go back to the sponsor for a quick review. If all looks good there, then we'll be able to calculate awards at that point and get started drafting the final report.

Hi @hickuphh3 I notice there is a difference between the announcement and https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-05-sturdy-contest, due to the fact that you're missing from the announcement, is it because you withdrawn from the contest as you were the judge ?


[06/18/2022 3:19 AM] hickuphh3
judges forefeit their earnings for a contest they participated and judged in to maintain impartiality


[06/18/2022 3:21 AM] hickuphh3
the leaderboard will take into account the judge's findings and reward though


[06/18/2022 10:55 AM] 0xdjango
Oh interesting. Was wondering why judges were competing sometimes.
